# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the WhatsApp Group Manager and Summarizer! Please follow these general guidelines to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process.

## How to Contribute

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub. Include a clear title, a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, your environment setup, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
*   **Suggesting Features:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to align on the proposal before any development work begins.
*   **Pull Requests:** For bug fixes or approved features, please submit a pull request.
    *   Fork the repository and create your branch from `main` (or the relevant development branch).
    *   Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding style (see below).
    *   If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
    *   Make sure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.
    *   Provide a clear description of the changes in your pull request. Link to any relevant issues.

## Development Setup

(Refer to the `README.md` for detailed setup instructions.)

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies using `pip install -e .`.
3.  Ensure you have a `.env` file configured with the necessary API keys and settings.

## Coding Guidelines

*   **Style:** Please try to follow PEP 8 for Python code. We may incorporate a linter (like Flake8 or Black) in the future to help automate this.
*   **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
*   **Testing:** For new features or significant bug fixes, please include unit or integration tests where applicable.
*   **Documentation:** Update any relevant documentation (README, docstrings, comments) if your changes impact it.
